## 🎯 Project Overview

**LACO AI** is an advanced AI-powered PDF analysis, summarization, and chatbot system designed for La Consolacion College Bacolod (LCCB), with a separate tier for general Business use. Admins upload documents under two distinct categories:

- **Public PDF** — safe, non-sensitive documents that power the embeddable chatbot widget, available to Business accounts and anonymous site visitors.
- **Sensitive PDF** — protected academic data (including student records and grades), restricted to verified LCCB roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) with email-based identity verification.

This educational project leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to transform how students, educators, and businesses interact with documents — while keeping sensitive institutional data walled off from public-facing chat surfaces.

### ⚠️ Beta Version Notice
This is a **BETA VERSION** for educational and research purposes only. Not intended for production or commercial use.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📄 Intelligent PDF Processing
- **Two PDF Tiers**: Admins categorize every upload as either **Public PDF** (safe for the chatbot widget and Business/general use) or **Sensitive PDF** (protected academic data, LCCB-only)
- **Smart Summarization**: Automatically generate concise summaries of lengthy PDF documents
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: AI understands document structure and extracts key information
- **Multi-PDF Support**: Upload and manage multiple documents simultaneously
- **Search & Filter**: Find PDFs quickly by filename
- **Right-Click Management**: Delete PDFs easily via context menu

### 💬 Interactive AI Chat
- **Ask Questions**: Query your documents and receive accurate, context-based answers
- **Embeddable Chatbot Widget**: `/chat_bot` serves anonymous, third-party site visitors using **Public PDF data only** — Sensitive PDFs are never exposed through this surface
- **Real-time Responses**: Powered by OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) for instant, intelligent feedback
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains chat history for continuous dialogue
- **PDF Context**: Select specific PDFs to chat about with AI assistance
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI response generation

### 👥 User Management & Roles
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Teacher, and Student permissions (LCCB, Sensitive PDF scope)
- **Business Accounts**: Separate tier for general document analysis using Public PDFs only
  - **Free Tier**: 1 PDF upload
  - **Enterprise Tier** (paid): up to 20 PDF uploads
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management, PDF categorization (Public/Sensitive), API logs, system monitoring
- **Teacher Supervision**: Monitor and filter content for students under 13
- **Student Accounts**: Independent access for users 13 and older
- **Profile Management**: Update name, upload profile pictures, change passwords

### 🔒 Security & Privacy
- **Public vs Sensitive Separation**: Sensitive PDFs (academic/grade data) are never served through the public chatbot widget or to Business accounts
- **Persistent Storage**: PDFs stored securely until manually deleted via right-click context menu
- **Profile Pictures**: Upload and manage profile pictures with automatic updates
- **Encrypted Authentication**: Secure JWT-based user authentication with HTTP-only cookies
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 request per second per IP to prevent spam and abuse

## 🎨 Design & User Experience

### Visual Design
- **Modern UI**: Clean, minimalist interface with adaptive theming
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant color contrast and keyboard navigation

### User Flow
1. **Landing Page** → Feature overview and project description
2. **Authentication** → Secure signup/login with email verification
3. **Dashboard/Chat Interface** → Upload and manage Public/Sensitive PDFs
4. **PDF Selection** → Choose document for AI interaction
5. **AI Chat** → Ask questions and receive OpenAI-powered responses
6. **Chatbot Widget** → Anonymous visitors chat against Public PDFs only
7. **Profile Management** → Update name, profile picture, password
8. **PDF Management** → Search, filter, categorize, and delete via right-click menu
9. **Admin Panel** (Admin only) → User management, PDF categorization, and system monitoring
## ⚡ **How It Works**

### Request Flow
1. **User Interaction** → Frontend components (React/Next.js)
2. **API Request** → Next.js API routes handle client requests
3. **Rate Limiting** → Cooldown check (1 request/second per IP)
4. **Authentication** → JWT verification, CSRF protection, origin validation (skipped for anonymous widget visitors, who are scoped to Public PDFs only)
5. **PDF Processing** → Python Flask server downloads and processes the selected PDF (Public or Sensitive) from Supabase
6. **AI Analysis** → OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) analyzes content and generates a contextual response, respecting the Public/Sensitive boundary
7. **Database Logging** → Supabase records API usage, user actions, and timestamps
8. **Response Delivery** → AI-generated answer returned to frontend
9. **File Management** → PDFs stored until manual deletion via context menu

### Technical Workflow
```
User / Widget Visitor → Next.js UI → API Routes → Rate Limit Check → JWT Auth (if applicable)
→ CSRF/Origin Validation → Flask API → Supabase Storage (Public / Sensitive bucket)
→ PDF Download → PDF Processing → OpenAI API 
→ AI Response → Database Log → User Display
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Beta Version**: May contain bugs and unexpected behavior
- **Rate Limiting**: 1 request per second per IP address (HTTP 429 on excess)
- **Large PDFs**: Very large documents may experience processing delays or timeouts
- **OpenAI API Limits**: Subject to OpenAI API rate limits and quotas
- **File Persistence**: PDFs stored until manual deletion (no auto-cleanup)
- **No Offline Mode**: Requires internet connection for AI processing
- **Search Limited**: Search only by filename, not document content
- **Email Dependency**: Password reset requires email verification
- **Manual Categorization**: Public/Sensitive classification is set by the admin at upload time — misclassification is the uploader's responsibility (see Privacy Policy §6)

### Planned Improvements
- [x] Enhanced PDF chunking algorithm for better context retention
- [x] Conversation history export and management
- [ ] Multi-language support for international users
- [x] Advanced search within document content
- [x] Document comparison and diff features
- [x] Batch PDF processing
- [x] Mobile app version
- [x] Improved admin analytics dashboard
- [ ] Custom AI model fine-tuning for educational content

- **Right-Click Delete**: Easy PDF removal via context menu
- **Profile Pictures**: Securely stored, automatically replaced when updated
- **Encrypted Passwords**: Industry-standard bcrypt hashing
- **JWT Authentication**: HTTP-only cookies for secure token storage
- **API Key Protection**: All endpoints require authentication and rate limiting
- **CSRF Protection**: Origin header validation on all requests
- **No External Data Sharing**: Your documents processed by OpenAI per their privacy policy
- **Rate Limiting**: Cooldown mechanism prevents spam (1 req/sec per IP)

### Compliance
- Apache License 2.0
- Educational use only
- No illegal activities supported
- GDPR-conscious design (no unnecessary data retention)
- See the [Privacy Policy](https://lccb-ai-2.vercel.app/privacy) for the full Public/Sensitive PDF data-handling terms
